# Data2LD-Matlab: Fast and Stable Estimation for Linear Dynamical Systems

This repository provides MATLAB code implementing the Data2LD (Data to Linear Dynamics) framework introduced in the aforementioned paper. The methodology offers a fast and stable approach for estimating parameters in linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) from noisy and incomplete data, leveraging the linearity of the system to simplify computations and improve estimation accuracy.

##  Overview

The Data2LD framework builds upon the parameter cascading approach, where a linear combination of basis functions approximates the solution of the dynamical system. The system's parameters are then estimated to ensure that this approximating solution adheres to the observed data. Key features include:

- Efficient estimation of parameters in linear ODEs.
- Incorporation of B-spline basis functions for flexible function approximation.
- Implementation of an iterative scheme for fast and stable computation.
- Support for real-world applications, such as biomechanics data analysis.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

The repository contains the following key files and directories:

- `Data2LD.m`: Main function implementing the Data2LD estimation procedure.
- `Data2LD_Opt.m`: Optimization routines for parameter estimation.
- `Data2LD_ISE.m`: Computes the Integrated Squared Error for model evaluation.
- `create_modelCell.m`: Constructs the model cell structure defining the ODE system.
- `inprod_basis_Data2LD.m`: Computes inner products of basis functions specific to Data2LD.
- `Setup:Install.m`: Script to set up the environment and install necessary components.
- `Examples/`: Directory containing example scripts and data demonstrating the usage of Data2LD.
- `fdaM.zip`: Archive containing the Functional Data Analysis MATLAB toolbox required for basis function operations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- MATLAB (version R2014b or later recommended)
- Functional Data Analysis (FDA) MATLAB toolbox
- Basic knowledge of ODEs and numerical methods
